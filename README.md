# Market place
_Group 2 software design project_

## Introduction
Market place is a web-based application that intends to function similarly to websites such as [Amazon](http://amazon.com/) and [Takealot](https://www.takealot.com/) as an online market place for users to browse and buy products from.

## Documentation

We have documentation detailing the usage of our system here [Getting Started](https://github.com/2153068/Market-Place/wiki/Getting-Started) and after you've created your account we have documentation detailing the usage of the [Homepage](https://github.com/2153068/Market-Place/wiki/Home-Page)
